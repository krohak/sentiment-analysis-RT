    "In the pre-deep learning era, NLP was a thriving field that saw lots of different advancements. However, in all of the successes in the aforementioned tasks, one needed to do a lot of feature enginering and thus had to have a lot of domain knowledge in linguistics. Entire 4 year degrees are devoted to this field of study, as practitioners needed to be comfortable with terms like phonemes and morphemes. In the past few years, deep learning has seen incredible progress and has largely removed the requirement of strong domain knowledge. As a result of the lower barrier to entry, applications to NLP tasks have been one of the biggest areas of deep learning research. "

Without going into too much detail, the model creates word vectors by looking at the context with which words appear in sentences. Words with similar contexts will be placed close together in the vector space. In natural language, the context of words can be very important when trying to determine their meanings. Taking our previous example of the words \"adore\" and \"love\", consider the types of sentences we'd find these words in.\n",

This is an indication that both words have something in common and can possibly be synonyms. Context is also very important when considering grammatical structure in sentences. Most sentences will follow traditional paradigms of having verbs follow nouns, adjectives precede nouns, and so on. For this reason, the model is more likely to position nouns in the same general area as other nouns. The model takes in a large dataset of sentences (English Wikipedia for example) and outputs vectors for each unique word in the corpus. The output of a Word2Vec model is called an embedding matrix.\n",

The specifics of this training procedure can get a little complicated, so we’re going to skip over the details for now, but the main takeaway here is that inputs into any Deep Learning approach to an NLP task will likely have word vectors as input.\n",

W<sup>H</sup> is a matrix that stays the same across all time steps, and the weight matrix W<sup>X</sup> is different for each input. \n",

When the magnitude of W<sup>H</sup> is large and the magnitude of W<sup>X</sup> is small, we know that h<sub>t</sub> is largely affected by h<sub>t-1</sub> and unaffected by x<sub>t</sub>.

As we saw in the previous section, the formulation for h in traditional RNNs is relatively simple. This approach won't be able to effectively connect together information that is separated by more than a couple time steps. We can illiustrate this idea of handling long term dependencies through an example in the field of question answering. The function of question answering models is to take an a passage of text, and answer a question about its content. Let's look at the following example.\n",

Basically, the addition of LSTM units make it possible to determine the correct and useful information that needs to be stored in the hidden state vector.\n",

    "Looking at LSTM units from a more technical viewpoint, the units take in the current word vector x<sub>t</sub> and output the hidden state vector h<sub>t</sub>.

Each intermediate state gets fed into different pipelines and eventually the information is aggregated to form h<sub>t</sub>. For simplicity sake, we won't go into the specific formulations for each gate, but it's worth noting that each of these gates can be thought of as different modules within the LSTM that each have different functions. The input gate determines how much emphasis to put on each of the inputs, the forget gate determines the information that we'll throw away, and the output gate determines the final h<sub>t</sub> based on the intermediate states. For more information on understanding the functions of the different gates and the full equations, check out Christopher Olah's great [blog post](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/).\n",

    "Looking back at the first example with question “What is the sum of the two numbers?”, the model would have to be trained on similar types of questions and answers. The LSTM units would then be able to realize that any sentence without numbers will likely not have an impact on the answer to the question, and thus the unit will be able to utilize its forget gate to discard the unnecessary information about the dog, and rather keep the information regarding the numbers.

      "i must admit that i was a tad skeptical of \" good will hunting \" , based both on the previews and the first fifteen minutes of the film , in which the main character will hunting ( matt damon ) , an mit janitor in his early twenties , is discovered to be an einstein-level closet genius when he solves two extraordinarily difficult math problems overnight . \n",
      "\n",
      "the only problem is that will is a tough street kid who's had his share of run-ins with the law , and before long he's being hauled in for assault after a parking lot fight . \n",
      "\n",
      "professor lambeau ( stellan skarsgard ) , who had brought up the math problems in his lectures , tracks him down and strikes a deal with the police : will is to be released , provided he works with lambeau on his math research regularly and attends therapy sessions . \n",
      "\n",
      "this sounds like the formula for mildly charming fluff , but \" good will hunting \" rises above its fairly mundane premise to deliver a poignant and clever drama . \n",
      "\n",
      "a conflict gradually emerges between lambeau and will's therapist sean mcguire ( robin williams ) - lambeau wants to get will to use his brain , while sean wants him to listen to his heart , both of which he has been largely neglecting . \n",
      "\n",
      "will finds that the former is much easier than the latter , so much so , in fact , that he gets bored with it and grows increasingly resistant to lambeau's attempts to recruit him into the academic lifestyle . \n",
      "\n",
      "he also has his share of problems with his girlfriend skylar ( minnie driver ) , an mit student who is moving to california at the end of the school year and would like a reluctant will to come with her . \n",
      "\n",
      "what makes \" good will hunting \" work so well , aside from the strong performances ( especially from damon and williams ) , is the depth of characterization and the representation of the conflicts in will's life . \n",
      "\n",
      "the script's sympathies seem to lie more with sean mcguire than with lambeau , but neither of them is presented as completely right or wrong . \n",

      "lambeau , while he may seem a little cold at times , is still written well enough that we like him as a character even when we're not sure if we like what he has to say . \n",
      "\n",
      "and sean , for all his warm-heartedness , has , as lambeau and later will point out , not lived up to his full intellectual potential either ; the therapy sessions turn out to be just as revelatory for sean as they do for will . \n",
      "\n",
      "will's reaction to this situation , and the way in which he slowly becomes more receptive to skylar and to sean , is presented in a believable fashion and in a way that forces the audience to consider all the characters' opinions , rather than setting up an obvious \" right \" and \" wrong \" side and beating them over the head with it . \n",
      "\n",
      "for a film with such an extraordinary character , \" good will hunting \" presents itself as remarkably ordinary ; it achieves the difficult task of making the next albert einstein into an everyman , a character to whom the audience can easily relate and who must make choices similar to those that almost everyone faces at one time or another . \n",
      "\n",
      "this film gives us real drama when it so easily could have given us merely melodrama , by having the government kidnap will to use him in covert spy missions or introducing some other equally far-fetched situation . \n",
      "\n",
      " \" good will hunting \" also has its share of fun humor , such as when will , in an early therapy session , pretends to be hypnotized and smoothly parodies the alien abduction scenarios that have become so well known in popular culture . \n",
      "\n",
      "and in the one scene in which government agents do in fact appear , will blows them off with a hilariously scathing accusation of human rights violations in africa . \n",
      "\n",
      "will's relationship with his friends , most notably chucky ( ben affleck ) , is usually rather amusing , if somewhat crude ( the film has 100+ uses of the 'f' word , which was most likely the reason for its r-rating ) , and lends itself well to the development of will's character . \n",
      "\n",
      "add all this to the fact that \" good will hunting \" even manages to pull off an uplifting happy ending without getting excessively sentimental , and you might be wondering why i haven't given this film four stars . \n",
      "\n",
      "well , for one thing , no matter how well damon and affleck , who wrote the screenplay , and director gus van sant pull it off , the story is still rather contrived and not particularly original . \n",
      "\n",
      "there are also a few scenes that did feel a bit formulaic , including one that was supposed to be emotional but really just seemed like the obligatory crying scene for any movie involving therapy sessions . \n",
      "\n",
      "still , \" good will hunting \" takes its premise a lot farther than i thought it would , and is definitely one of the better personal dramas i have seen in the last few years , and as of right now it stands as one of the top five on my list of '97 films . \n",

However, when analyzing training curves, we should also pay special attention to the possibility of our model overfitting the training dataset. Overfitting is a common phenomenon in machine learning where a model becomes so fit to the training data that it loses the ability to generalize to the test set. This means that training a network until you achieve 0 training loss might not be the best way to get an accurate model that performs well on data it has never seen before. Early stopping is an intuitive technique commonly used with LSTM networks to combat this issue. The basic idea is that we train the model on our training set, while also measuring its performance on the test set every now and again. Once the test error stops its steady decrease and begins to increase instead, you'll know to stop training, since this is a sign that the network has begun to overfit. "
